# mauifiresurvey - repo rules

**Retrofitted by `/init-client --retrofit` on 2026-08-21 from what was on disk.** Every line below
is either DETECTED or explicitly UNKNOWN. Nothing here was inferred and then stated as fact. Correct
it the first time you work in this repo.

## Stack
Single-file static HTML/CSS/JS. No framework.

## Deploy target
**Netlify project `mauifiresurvey`, live at `https://mauifirepulse.com`**

## Does a push publish?
**YES. A push to this repo publishes.** It carries a Netlify git webhook
(`https://api.netlify.com/hooks/github`), so pushing builds and deploys the live site.
Build and verify BEFORE you push.

Settled 2026-08-21 by `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks` across all 48 retrofitted repos,
plus a check for a deploying GitHub Action. Control: `publicsafetyfactshawaii`, which is
documented as auto-deploying, returned the Netlify hook, so the test detects git-linkage
rather than silently returning empty.

**CORRECTED 2026-08-21, same day, and it WEAKENS the verdict above: `gh api .../hooks` is the
right test for NETLIFY ONLY. It is the WRONG test for a HOSTINGER git deploy AND for VERCEL,
which uses a GitHub APP that registers no repo-level webhook (proven on `ohana-pickleball`:
zero hooks, yet its Vercel production deploy landed 3m21s after the last pushed commit).** Proven by controlled
test on `frontline-website`: pushing commit `b024a2c` and doing nothing else redeployed the live
site inside a minute, while that repo carries ZERO GitHub webhooks. Hostinger's hPanel GIT
integration triggers without registering a repo-level hook, so a zero here does NOT rule out a
Hostinger auto-deploy. **Corroborating probe, which does work:** a repo `.md` served live means
the server holds a git CHECKOUT; a 404 means it holds uploaded output only. Measured 2026-08-21,
`bronzeage`, `designresource`, `holu`, `freshhaven`, `keokea` and `unclemahis` all 404 their
`BRIEF.md` while serving their root, so those are zip deploys and the NO above holds for them.
**For any repo not on that probed list, treat the NO as UNVERIFIED for Hostinger and check hPanel
-> Advanced -> GIT before relying on it.**


## Remote
`git@github.com:tannermosher2015-debug/mauifiresurvey.git`, branch `main`.

## Verify path
`shot.ps1` desktop + mobile, **both reviewed**, plus `impeccable detect` on the
built HTML. Every edit gets both shots before a deploy, including one-character ones.

## Landmines
<Empty. Add each one the day it bites, with the date.>
